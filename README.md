Summerize all this:"I worked as a QA on GTA VI last year. here’s what i can tell you.
not tryna be that guy, but I used to work QA on gta vi for a while, left mid last year. wasn’t high level or anything, but I was around long enough to see and hear some wild shit. i don’t expect this post to stay up long

first off, the vi mapping project that’s been going around? yeah, obviously a lot of it was based on the 2022 leaks and triangulating stuff from the clips and trailer, everyone knew that. but internally, some people were still caught off guard by how accurate parts of it were. there were meetings where they were trying to figure out if maybe something older had slipped out way before the public leaks even happened. like, some of the stuff in that fan map lined up a little too well with terrain data from earlier dev builds, stuff that shouldn’t have been out there at all. it wasn’t about the public clips being used, it was the overlap with old layouts that had never been in any footage. no one ever got to the bottom of it, but it definitely had people on edge for a bit.

the main city is obviously vice city, but the stuff outside of it is what caught me off guard. way more countryside than people think. like, backwater florida mixed with weird swamp cult vibes. there’s this one area people joked about calling meth county. everything’s busted up, trailers, sinkholes, alligators, and sketchy npcs walking around at night. saw some weird events pop up in the logs too, with names like “strange gathering” and “property sealed”. definitely some secret type shit out there.

the npc memory stuff is way deeper than what they had in rdr2. like, people actually remember you for real. not just bumping into them or starting fights either. i stole a guys bike in this little neighborhood during one of my test runs, and two in-game days later, i walked through that area again and he spotted me, pulled his phone out and started filming while talking shit like he recognized me. another time, a store clerk refused to serve me because i caused a scene outside his shop earlier. it’s not always super obvious, sometimes you’ll just notice people looking at you differently or crossing the street when you walk by. but when it hits, it hits. even the cops act different. i ran from them in one area, and when i got pulled over a while later, the officer actually mentioned the last chase. it’s like the world doesn’t forget, and that honestly makes everything feel more alive and way more intense. i had this one situation where someone i robbed early on showed up way later in a mission and tried to jump me. not scripted either, it just triggered because of how I handled something earlier in the build. crazy stuff.

the map is huge. not just big, but layered. there’s underwater stuff, restricted zones, even rooftops that connect in ways you wouldn’t expect. and it’s not just empty space, they’re trying to make every area feel lived in. like, i walked into a bait shop in a test zone, and the old man behind the counter had, like, five lines of dialogue that changed depending on what time it was. none of it was even related to a mission. i remember the voice work for stuff like that, like the guy in the bait shop, was grouped under something like ambient chatter in their convo system. i don’t remember the exact tag, but it was labeled differently from mission stuff. felt like it was tied to time of day flags more than anything scripted.

there’s also stuff you can do during traffic stops that blew my mind. like hiding things in glove boxes or under seats before the cops walk up. depending on what you’re carrying and how you play it, they might search the car or let you go. if you stash something quick enough and play it cool, you can actually get away with it. the AI seemed to respond to where you were looking or how fast you moved too. it wasn’t just a prompt or button press.

the driving felt like a mix between 5 and 4. not as floaty as 5, but not full sim either. cars feel heavier, like you actually feel the weight shift if you’re tearing around a corner too fast. dirt roads and rain made a huge difference too, way more than i expected. i remember one of the big things people were talking about in the dev meetings was how the car modifications are so much more full on this time. it’s way more in depth. the driving is almost sim like, depending on how your car is set up and tuned. you can literally notice the difference when you add mods, especially suspension upgrades. i had this one car that felt super heavy with body roll, but once i fit some racing suspension, it handled so much better. you could feel it immediately.

shooting npcs actually got to me at times. the reactions are brutal. some people would just scream in agony, others would beg for their life or ask why you did it. there were so many different dialogue lines that no moment ever felt the same. it’s not like 5, where you blast someone and move on. this time it felt like you were really doing something awful, especially in quiet areas. and the gore is nuts. not over the top cartoonish, just super realistic. same with the physics, bodies react depending on where you hit them, and i remember some feedback sessions about making sure it didn’t get too disturbing for players.

don’t expect the story to kick off with a bang. from what i heard it’s more of a slow burn at the start, then slowly, stuff starts falling apart around you. apparently feels way more grounded than 5 at first. kinda like more personal and a more serious tone, kinda how 4 was.

there were also random conversations popping up in slack about the bermuda. no idea if it’s a location or part of a bigger mystery, but people joked that it’s gonna last longer than the mount chiliad stuff in 5. apparently there’s stuff hidden so well that most players will never find it. i didn’t see any of it directly, but the way devs talked about it made it sound like a big deal.

i also never saw any actual hurricane mechanics or natural disaster stuff like some people keep speculating. doesn’t mean it’s not in there, just never came up during any of the test cycles I was involved with.

and the new online is being kept so tightly under wraps than anything else. that’s seriously the last thing they want leaking right now. i’d hear some devs talk about it, and they’d make it sound like the biggest thing the world’s ever seen. apparently they’ve learned so much from the feedback on v’s online, and it sounds like they’ve really made it feel deeper. apparently having tonne’s of ideas for live events and one of the other things that stuck with me was how they’re improving the in game economy. apparently it’s way more realistic now how you earn money, buy things, all of it’s more grounded.

take this how you want i’m just putting it out there. i don’t care if you think it’s fake, i’m not answering dm’s or replying on this post. from what i got to work on, all i can tell you is this will be the biggest game ever made and it will be so hard for even rockstar to top this game again let alone another developer. expectations will either be met or completely exceeded. i can only imagine how proud rockstar is of this game, and i can’t wait for everyone to experience what people like me, the other testers, and the devs had the privilege of working on. i will post a part two once i gather more thoughts. alright i wasn’t gonna post again but since my last post i figured i’d drop a bit more info while i still remember some of it. like i said before i left mid last year so some of this might’ve changed by now, but this is all stuff i saw or tested personally.

first thing i wanna talk about more is the cars. the whole driving and modding system is way deeper now. stealing high end cars isn’t easy anymore. some have immobilizers and you need to bypass them using said tools or messing with the wiring, especially for the luxury ones. some testers used to call it the lux rip system. there’s tracker jammers too, you can use them to mess with police gps if you’re being chased. fuel is a real thing now too, you gotta fill up at petrol stations. gas lasts a fair while, devs didn’t want it to be annoying, but if you ignore it you will run out at some point. and your car actually degrades over time. if you don’t get it serviced at one of the shops, it’ll start breaking down and feel rough to drive. one of the shops during my time was called Boulevard Car Workz, no idea if that name stuck. car meets are in, full on scenes with people showing off mods, chatting, then cruising together. there’s even a whole underground street racing scene and full lowrider meets like san andreas, with the bounce minigames and everything. car customization goes deep too, with unlockable parts and not just what’s available from the start.

your character actually takes real damage. if you get shot in the leg or arm, it affects how you move or drive. like trying to steer or sprint is harder if you’re hurt. trauma kits and medical supplies are new items, more advanced than just snacks or armor. they let you recover faster from major injuries, but they’re rare. getting into car crashes, falling from heights. it all adds up and changes how your character performs. there were some systems tied to long term injuries too but i didn’t get to test that much of it.

inventory works more like rdr2 now. what you wear matters. backpacks, duffle bags, jackets with extra pockets. they all increase how much you can carry. you can’t just walk around with an entire arsenal anymore. if you’re wearing light clothes, you gotta plan ahead. it actually makes robberies and missions feel more tense cause you gotta choose what you bring.

the police ai has been seriously upgraded. they can now breathalyze and drug test you. if you’re swerving or driving crazy, they might pull you over and make you do a sobriety test. i failed one once and the cop arrested me. there’s also systems tied to being recognized. police cameras and any surveillance cameras around the map can recognise you and alert police that you are wanted and in the area and they will patrol that area more for awhile. and if you’re wanted in an area and don’t lay low or change your outfit, shopkeepers might call the cops or refuse to serve you. some stores will straight up lock their doors if you’ve caused too much trouble in that part of the map. also if you steal a cop car, you can access police records, it’s a much deeper version of gta 4’s system.

murders are handled different now too. you can hide bodies in trunks, dumpsters, even bury them in remote areas. if you do it clean, cops might not even know a crime happened. but a few in game days later, you might see a report come up because a family member noticed the npc is missing. it’s possible to actually become a serial killer in the game if you keep it lowkey. homeless npcs are easier to get away with cause nobody reports them. also, running people over damages your car a lot more than before. if you hit multiple pedestrians, your engine starts smoking and the car swerves bad and it’s all dependent on how much damage the car has and makes getaways way harder.

activities in the world are nuts. golf is back, bowling too, but there’s new games like table tennis, tennis, dice, and you can bet on horse races or car races. there’s a full casino in the city as well as smaller casinos/bars where you can gamble on slot machines and table games. you can also stumble across random events like beach parties, birthday gatherings, even full music festivals. npc behavior changes based on day and time. friday and saturday nights you’ll see people partying, clubs packed, drunk people on the street yelling and dancing. it’s wild. and yeah, gym’s in the game. you can work out to build strength and stamina, as well as shooting, driving and flying. actually impacts gameplay more than gta 5 did too.

fishing and hunting are in, and they go pretty deep. you can use different rods, bait types, even a speargun for underwater stuff. animals have different values and rarities. you can sell what you catch or hunt to regular buyers or black market ones. felt kinda like rdr2 but more expanded.

robbing houses and npcs gives you stuff you can sell to pawn shops or shady dealers. it’s not always cash either, sometimes it’s items or jewelry. there’s a proper economy behind it. and you can also do gig jobs like driving people around in a rideshare system, kind of like gta’s version of uber. taxi and bus jobs are back too, but a little more involved.

anyway that’s what i remember right now. again, believe it or don’t. just sharing what i saw. yes this game is massive and i will probably have more i remember. Not sure if this is something you’d be aware of, but will it be cross-platform between ps5 & xbox?

honestly i couldn’t say for sure, that kinda stuff was way above my level. most of the stuff i saw or heard was just from QA chatter or dev convos during test cycles. i do remember people mentioning crossplay being on the table during some of the early online talks, but nothing ever confirmed while i was there. wouldn’t surprise me though, with how big they’re going for this.

i didn’t do much vehicle combat testing myself but from what i saw yeah it’s way more detailed. tanks felt like they had proper weak spots, like shots to the rear doing way more damage. don’t know about ammo racks blowing up or turrets flying off but i def remember convos about not wanting that old ‘x number of rockets = boom’ system. think it’s more angle based now, like armor actually matters.

there’s an electronics store in the game where you can buy a phone. if your phone gets taken or destroyed, you’ll have to buy a new one. It adds a bit more depth to the realism, especially when you’re tied into the social media and other features in the game.

I get why you’d think that. honestly, it’s not about the risk for me. i’ve seen and experienced enough to know how amazing this game could be. rockstar might go to extreme lengths to protect their work, but I feel like people deserve to know what’s coming, especially with how much excitement there is around it. if I go down for it, then that’s on me, but at least people get to hear what i saw firsthand

yeah, I get what you’re saying. even if this all ends up being speculation or doesn’t fully line up later, i can tell you from my experience working there, that there’s a lot of stuff in this game that’s going to blow people away. whether it’s the world changing events or the next level realism, there’s so much potential here. if it pans out the way I’ve seen, it’ll definitely be something special. i’m just sharing what I remember and hoping it gets people as excited as I am.

from what i remember it’s an island, but it’s huge and doesn’t really feel like one when you’re playing. there’s coastlines, beaches, bridges, even big swamp areas and rivers that break things up. you can go way inland and forget you’re even surrounded by water. it’s not like rdr2 where you hit invisible walls, it feels more open and natural.

nah it still has that rockstar feel for sure. like yeah it’s super realistic in how things react and play out, but it’s not boring or too much. it still feels like a game, just a really detailed one. they’ve always been good at balancing realism with fun and this is no different. it’s grounded, but you still get those wild moments that make gta what it is. it’s more immersive, not restrictive.

nah you’re good. honestly from what i saw and heard, the biggest thing this time isn’t just one feature, it’s how everything ties together. like the world feels aware of you. not just reactive, but like it remembers. choices stacking up, people responding differently over time, even stuff you forgot you did coming back later. it’s less about one flashy gimmick and more how alive and connected everything feels. one of the devs even said “the world changes even when you’re not on,” and that always stuck with me. they’re leaning heavy into immersion and consequence this time. feels like the game is always moving, even when you’re not there to see it.

i didn’t get to test the water much myself but they had a whole separate team focused just on that side of things. ocean systems, wave physics, all that. every time it came up in slack or meetings, people would say “water team’s going crazy” so i’m guessing it’s a big step up. even from what little i saw, it looked way more detailed and reactive than anything in v.

basically if a cop’s behind you and wants to pull you over, you’ll see the lights and hear a quick siren blip just like real life. sometimes they’ll use the megaphone too, like telling you to pull over. if you don’t stop right away, they get more aggressive, more sirens, tailing you tighter, eventually escalating to a chase if you keep going.

when you do pull over, you gotta sit still. if you move too fast or start reaching around the car, they might get suspicious. they walk up like in real life and depending on what you’ve got on you or how you act, things can go smooth or sideways. you can stash stuff in gloveboxes or under seats before they reach the window, and that actually affects what happens.

if you’re clean and chill, sometimes they just let you off with a warning. but if they find something or if your car’s flagged, it can lead to searches, arrests, or even a full pursuit. it’s way more layered than gta 5.

can’t say for sure on the phone brand, it looked like a new ui but could still be ifruit just redesigned. the phone’s super important tho, way more interactive than before. like full social media stuff, live streams, location tracking, shops, all that.

as for cars, yeah you can swap personal vehicles out. there’s garages and spots where you keep them, and yeah there’s dealerships and a bunch of places where you can go buy and customize them. different dealerships selling certain cars and different mod shops specialising in certain vehicle modifications.

and yeah weapon mods are back and it goes pretty deep. scopes, mags, attachments, even tweaks to how it handles. felt more detailed than v for sure.

vice is the main city yeah but outside of it there’s a lot more than people think. there’s a few towns scattered around the map, each with their own vibe. nothing as big as vice but some are still decent size, like you’ll spend time in them for sure. there’s this one more urban area northwest i remember that felt kinda like a mini city, had apartments, fast food joints, and a courthouse or something. definitely not just empty space outside vice. like i already said the vi mapping project has it almost pretty spot on

yeah, it’s definitely a lot more realistic than previous games. the npc reactions, world events, and the way everything feels alive is next level. It’s not just the visuals it’s how everything interacts with you. like, people actually remember what you do, whether it’s good or bad. i replied to a guy above about social media also and that’s all i know.

the whole mobile phone and social media thing is actually way bigger than people might think. npcs are constantly posting stuff, and it’s not just random chatter. you can keep track of stores, what stock they have, new items, and even follow certain feeds or streams. it’s like this living, breathing world where you’re always plugged in. the news updates, live streams, and everything make the world feel way more connected and alive. definitely adds a lot more depth to the game compared to previous ones.

my time as a internal QA tester.
hey all, i wanted to clear up how I got the info i’ve shared. so, i was an internal qa tester for about a year and a half, almost two years to be exact during vi’s development. i wasn’t given access to the full game. rockstar had set up full testing zones, and i was limited to certain areas to test specific mechanics, parts of the map, and ai behavior.

a lot of the info i learned came from third party sources like other employees, and over time, i started picking up on new details just by being in the testing zones. rockstar didn’t hand me the entire game to run wild with. my role was focused more on testing isolated elements, not playing through the story.

i’ve seen what people are saying about how if this info were real, i would’ve expanded on things more. but honestly, a lot of this information was already available in leaks, though some of it wasn’t confirmed and a lot wasn’t in any leaks at all. i just wanted to share what I know from my experience in qa, but i can’t confirm every little detail.

also, for those who’ve seen the leaked gameplay videos, those are all test videos that testers like me would make. they would clip certain parts of the game to send over to developers in other departments through slack. after the leaks, rockstar completely stopped that practice and tightened up security. they realized how easy it was for that kind of info to get out, and they didn’t want it happening again. i joined the internal team after slack was completely restricted from being used as it was deemed not safe any more.

so while I can’t speak to everything, what i’ve shared is based on what i had access to during my time as a tester. hopefully that helps clarify things.

i get what you’re asking, but the truth is, anything too specific could risk people at rockstar figuring out who i am, or narrow it down too much. a lot of what we had access to was segmented, and even though the game was far along, the build wasn’t final, so some details could still change. but there’s little things i’ve mentioned, like npc social media posts reflecting live world events, or the way stores have rotating stock you can follow through your phone. those are systems that weren’t really in the leaks, and are too interconnected to be easily faked. when the game drops, people will see that stuff and remember i talked about it. plus, if more of the game gets shown off, i might drop something else more proof like, but still vague enough to protect myself.

yeah there were murmurs internally around targeting fall for release, which everyone knows now. but nothing was concrete when i was there, just general talk about being on track for that window. marketing wise i remember hearing they were aiming for summer to kick off the full rollout, like more trailers, screenshots and other promo stuff, probably starting after the investor call or sometime mid year but nothing was locked in when i left and that side of it was kept tight. only higher ups really had the full picture.

i’d say around 40 to 60 percent of buildings were enterable in the zones i tested, some more detailed than others. not every room in every building was accessible but a good number had multiple explorable rooms, especially commercial or story relevant spaces. residential spots sometimes had just a few rooms but some were fully walkable.

they definitely used some procedural tech or ai assisted tools to fill out interiors faster, like furniture layout or clutter would change between similar building types so it didn’t feel copy paste. you could tell some of it was hand touched but it had that auto generated baseline to help scale things up across the zones i tested.

there were definitely a few aircrafts in the build, some felt familiar to v but i remember one jet that looked real close to a f22 or something like that. can’t speak on the full lineup but there’s a good mix. speed felt more grounded compared to v’s faster jets, like you could feel more weight and handling depth

fishing is more involved than rdr2, especially with the newer mechanics. you can fish off certain boats now, and reeling in has more player control this time. some fish fight harder depending on size or type and there’s a small learning curve to it that makes it feel more rewarding

can’t confirm frame rates specifically but the build i was testing was 30fps but it was real clean. obviously not fully optimized but it didn’t feel like cyberpunk at launch. more stable than that. current gen consoles should handle it fine, they’re definitely aiming for a solid 30 fps with possible performance modes for more

fav thing? honestly the way the world reacts to you. small stuff like people recording you if you act wild, shops remembering you if you caused trouble, and just how the ai traffic shifts in different weather or time of day. it’s all super dynamic. hard to explain until you’re in it

appreciate you reading through all of it man. yeah you can buy properties from what i saw. some are tied to progression and others you can just purchase straight up. nothing too crazy like building from scratch, but definitely ownership. and yeah with vehicles it’s more like rdr2 horses, where jason and lucia have their “main” ride, but you can change it. garages work a bit different this time, they feel more grounded. if your car gets impounded or wrecked you’ll have to go get it or fix it, it doesn’t just magically reappear. adds a nice layer of immersion.

the truth is i’m not gonna post anything that’d fully burn me, even if it’s not a “leak” by definition. rockstar tracks everything, and they know how to find you. i’ve said what i’ve said cause i know people are hungry for real info, but proof like that would just make it too easy to pinpoint me. if they find me off this alone, so be it but i’m not handing them the nail and the hammer.

no stress at all. based on what i saw, the vi mapping project was pretty spot on in terms of layout and size. i’d say the map felt around 2.5x bigger than gta v, maybe more when you factor in how dense and detailed everything is. and yeah there’s definitely vehicles in there for car heads, can’t say exact names but if you’re into trackhawks you’ll be happy for sure.

yeah there’s definitely more detail with gore. i saw limbs get blown off with explosives or high caliber rounds, blood pools under bodies, and depending on where someone’s hit, you’ll see different reactions. nothing overly excessive but way more reactive and dynamic than gta v and rdr2. it’s brutal but still in that rockstar style where it serves the world and doesn’t feel too over the top.

yeah you can ride a horse. didn’t test it myself but saw it in a zone meant for more rural ai behavior, so it’s definitely in. as for the space/nasa stuff, there’s references and visuals in the world tied to that, like museums, launch sites and tourist stuff. not like you’re going to space or anything wild, but it’s part of the worldbuilding for sure.

yeah so vice city is the main one obviously, but there’s definitely more than just that. there’s at least one other full size city that’s not as big as vice but still feels like a real urban environment, plus a bunch of smaller towns and communities that each have their own vibe. like i said before, the vi mapping project is honestly pretty spot on with the layout. it’s not just empty space between places either, there’s stuff happening all throughout the map that makes traveling feel worth it.

yeah some of the patent stuff is definitely in the game, like the dynamic npc pathing and reactions, especially in traffic and crowds. you see way less robotic behavior and more like natural little decisions npcs make on the fly. interiors too, the way people move through them and interact with objects feels smoother

as for relationships, jason and lucia have a bond but it’s not like you’re managing some romance system. their relationship just evolves through gameplay and cutscenes depending on what’s going on. it’s dynamic in that they react to situations together but you’re not choosing dialogue or anything like that. it feels natural and story driven rather than like a system you control directly

from what i remember, there isn’t exactly a speed limiter like in mafia 2, but traffic cops are more aware of your speed. if you’re speeding through towns or streets at ridiculous speeds, you’ll definitely get attention from the cops. it won’t just be a regular traffic stop either. they’ll try to block you off or chase you down. the game really emphasizes making those high speed chases feel more realistic and tense.

definitely closer to iv in terms of the damage model. it’s more detailed and dynamic than v, with cars reacting more realistically to crashes, more deformation, parts flying off, and even the engine can get damaged in ways that impact performance. it feels like there’s a lot more variety in how cars handle damage, which adds to the immersion.

yeah, getting in was definitely competitive. i actually started out with smaller qa roles in the industry, just working my way up and building experience. eventually, I got some attention for my work and landed a spot at rockstar for a project they were working on. it’s all about having the right skills and making connections in the industry. it’s a mix of timing, experience, and a little bit of luck, honestly.

the gore is definitely more detailed than what we’ve seen in past titles, but it’s not over the top. it’s brutal in a way that feels grounded, people will react realistically to getting hit or shot, with more detailed wounds and blood splatter. it’s definitely more intense than rdr2, but not to the point where it feels gratuitous. they seem to strike a balance between realism and not making it too graphic for the sake of it.

honestly, I didn’t get to test every building, but from what I saw, there were a lot more enterable places than in previous gtas. I’d estimate around 40-60% of the buildings, especially in the more developed areas, were accessible. some were more interactive than others, but it felt like there was a lot more attention to detail in the environments.

you can’t fully change how they look but you can hit the gym to build muscle or stamina. like if you train enough they’ll sprint longer or get stronger in fights. if you just eat and don’t work out they’ll gain weight and it’ll start affecting stamina and strength. you can also change their hair, facial hair, and makeup, stuff like that. and depending on what you’re wearing, it can help after you commit a crime. changing outfits can shake the cops and let you back into areas or stores you couldn’t get into before cause you were wanted.

yeah it was pretty balanced but depending on the testing zone sometimes i’d be stuck as one or the other. both are solid honestly, lucia stood out more in some of the ai/reactive world stuff, jason had more variety with vehicles and interiors in what i played. can’t really pick a fav but they both felt fun in different ways

pc version wasn’t something we ever got to see or test directly. all the focus was on console builds. from what i heard, it’s not launching day one with console. they wanna make sure it’s super optimized and stable, especially after how the gta v pc rollout went. i’d guess like 6 to 12 months after console, but that’s just based on convo not anything confirmed.

all good i’ll answer what i can from my experience

performance wise the builds i played were mostly locked at 30fps which is normal for dev kits that aren’t fully optimized yet. it didn’t feel super choppy to me but definitely not final. textures were a mix some zones looked real polished others were still rough. lighting was already crazy even back then.

for interiors yeah there were a lot. in the zones i tested you could walk into a bunch of spots without loading screens. gas stations, little stores, apartments all felt like they were part of the open world not like separate levels. they clearly want more stuff to explore indoors

combat wise, yeah ammo felt more limited than gta v. not like you’re carrying ten guns at once. didn’t test sniping at long range but people joked that it actually mattered where you aimed now. recoil was noticeable too, full auto weapons kicked a lot more. i was on a playstation dev kit and the adaptive triggers worked like the shotgun felt heavy compared to pistols

the ui wasn’t final. some parts still had placeholders but it felt kinda like gta v just cleaner. weapon wheel was there. menus were slick. phone stuff i didn’t mess with too much but i saw messaging and notifications pop up like real texts from npcs or alerts. not sure if you could post stuff yourself though

i didn’t test planes or jets so can’t say much there. but i heard talk about changing how they fly to feel less arcadey. someone on the dev side said it’ll feel more like actual dogfights and not just flying in circles like gta v

hope that helps

• I worked as a QA on GTA VI last year. here’s what i can tell you.

it’s modern day. couldn’t tell you what year for sure.



more information that i can remember about GTA VI.
just a little more info i wanted to add based on what i saw during testing and have remembered. i haven’t been at rockstar for almost a year now, so things are coming back to me in small batches lol. it was a lot of information to take in and try and store.

shipments and shipping containers at the docks can be broken into and you can steal goods out of them, and can be sold to pawn shops and black markets or other contacts you have on your phone that might be interested. subway stations can all be used as public transport, and you can even take flights across the city to other areas. super yachts can actually be driven this time, not just static like in 5.

some minigames like pool and bowling make a return, and there’s new stuff too. you can download minigames on your phone and keep scores between friends. the phone also has an anonymous messaging app specifically used for black market deals and shady contacts, it hides your identity and location and is used for certain types of missions, trades and contacting individuals within your businesses.

like in rdr2, there’s different police departments for different counties. they can communicate with each other, so if you commit a crime in one county and flee to another, that new department might already be on alert.

the soundtrack was one of the most locked down parts of the game. during testing, all the music was still from gta 5. no new stations or songs were included in our testing builds.

you can own businesses in single player, both legal and illegal. they work similarly to gta 5 online, with upgrades, income, and optional missions. first person mode is back and a lot more customizable. it’s not as limited as in gta 5. when you’re in a car in first person, most of the third person hud disappears because things like speed, gps, and radio are all visible in the actual dashboard.

weapons sound incredible. car engines and exhausts too. changing your exhaust actually changes the sound a lot. everything feels built from scratch. honestly, it doesn’t feel like gta 5 or 4 or anything before it. it feels like they took the best of all of it and just pushed it way further.

like i said before, this game will be hard to beat by even rockstar themselves. it’s so deep and next level, it’s something they could easily build off of for the next 20+ years. i think it’d be crazy if they didn’t add more stories as dlc down the line, just like they did for gta iv.

yeah i didn’t personally get to see the airport interior myself during testing but i know it’s in the game and it’s not just a background thing. it’s functional and has depth to it from what others were saying. same with malls and big indoor spots like supermarkets, some of them are legit explorable and not just set pieces. as for things like museums or nasa style stuff, there’s definitely spots that resemble those kinds of landmarks but i didn’t explore everything in my time. the world feels big enough for it though. nothing like disneyworld that i saw, but there’s theme park like areas and large open attractions that are detailed. it’s all layered to feel like you’re actually living in the state.

ah got you. so when a cop pulls you over, it really depends on your recent behavior. if you’ve been speeding, driving reckless, or even if your car is linked to something shady, they’ll act way more suspicious. like they might ask you to step out or start questioning you more seriously. but if you’re records clean, and haven’t been flagged recently, it’s usually a quick check and you’re on your way. the system kinda builds a profile on how you’ve been acting leading up to that stop.

aircraft combat felt way deeper than v honestly, different missile types were being tested and yeah radar played a role in some of what we tried, especially with air to air tracking and evasion. wasn’t fully finished but the direction was clear.

reel speed was more about how fast you were on the stick, not some locked in animation. bigger fish definitely required more work though. a lot more interactive than rdr2 fishing for sure.

i wasn’t testing on retail consoles so final performance might vary. what i can say is they clearly care about optimization.

i don’t know the exact length of the story but from what i heard, it’s long. like rdr2 long or longer depending on how you play. lots of optional stuff too.

pricing wasn’t shared with us at all, but my guess would be the usual $70 to $100 range depending on edition. nothing crazy above that from what i could tell.

second trailer was being talked about internally around summer. i don’t know if that’s still the case but that was the aim back then.

social media is super detailed. you can follow people like npcs and players, post photos, go live, comment, scroll feeds. it’s not just fluff, it ties into missions and some side stuff too.

can’t say much on cheats since i never had access to that stuff, but i did hear whispers that cheats are still in and way more dynamic than before. not just classic invincibility stuff, but more in depth toggles too. take that with a grain though.

yeah from what i saw there wasn’t anything crazy on the base devkits in terms of ray tracing. reflections looked good but i doubt it was proper rtgi or anything too advanced, probably baked in or faked in certain spots. the trailer was most likely done on high end pc hardware or a pro devkit for sure, no way that level of polish was on the regular test builds we were working with.

yeah like if you loiter too long in certain areas, especially near active investigations or sketchy neighborhoods, they’ll start questioning you. running from them, or even stuff like changing outfits behind a building can raise suspicion. also if you’re constantly around known gang members or seen near crime scenes multiple times, they’ll start tagging you as a potential suspect even if you didn’t do anything. it’s not instant wanted levels, just more heat from cops during interactions.
